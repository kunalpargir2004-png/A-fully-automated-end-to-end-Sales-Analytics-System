This project delivers a fully automated, end-to-end Sales Analytics System, transforming multiple interlinked CSV files into a structured BI ecosystem using Power Query, Power Pivot, VBA automation, and Power BI. 
The solution supports automated refresh, PDF reporting, advanced DAX analytics, and executive-level interactive dashboards for data-driven decision-making.

Real-Life Business Problem Solved ⚙️
Problem: Sales data is scattered across multiple CSV/Excel files. Manual data cleaning, merging, refreshing reports, and exporting MIS PDFs can take 2–4 hours daily and is highly error-prone.
Solution:
Power Query: Automated data cleaning and consolidation
Power Pivot: Structured relational data model
VBA Automation: One-click full refresh and PDF export
Power BI: Real-time interactive dashboards for insights
Time Impact:
Manual process: ~3–4 hours
Automated process: 2–3 minutes (one click)
Reduces human errors and accelerates reporting cycles.
